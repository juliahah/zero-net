# Video Typology

## Research on Contemporary Video Culture — Focus on YouTube & TikTok

This research note explores contemporary video culture through the lens of two dominant platforms: YouTube and TikTok. Both have become central spaces for how moving images are produced, distributed, and consumed today. What once belonged to television and cinema is now reshaped into new, compressed, and highly optimized forms — governed not just by user creativity but also by algorithmic visibility and platform logic.

## Starting Point: What’s Most Viewed?

To understand what types of videos gain the most attention, I began by looking at lists of the most viewed videos and channels:

- [Most Viewed YouTube Videos (Wikipedia)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_most-viewed_YouTube_videos)  
- [Most Viewed YouTube Channels (Wikipedia)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_most-viewed_YouTube_channels)

These public records offer a broad sense of what dominates attention on YouTube. One observation is that the most-watched video of all time is *"Baby Shark Dance"* by Pinkfong. Children’s content, in general, occupies a large presence in the top-viewed lists. Entire channels are devoted to nursery rhymes, repetitive songs, and animated characters.

## Thumbnail Aesthetics

Before even pressing play, the viewer encounters the thumbnail — a condensed visual designed to attract attention in under a second. While seemingly disposable, thumbnails are the surface layer of a deeper aesthetic system. Many follow a collage-like formula: overly saturated colors, bold or distorted typefaces, exaggerated facial expressions, and cut-out figures placed against chaotic backgrounds. Faces are often enlarged, outlined, or contorted in a moment of emotion or surprise.

This aesthetic is not accidental. It is a strategic response to the scroll-based interface. Thumbnails function less as a preview and more like a sales pitch: a visual hook competing for the briefest glance in an endless feed.

## Typologies of Popular Video Forms

Through observing a wide spectrum of content, I began noticing recurring formats — genres that are less defined by content and more by rhythm, editing style, and platform performance. These forms repeat not because of tradition but because they work.

### Unboxing and Haul Videos

In the genre of unboxing and haul videos, the object becomes the central character. A new gadget, a clothing item, or a skincare product is slowly revealed to the viewer, held and turned by the creator’s hands, often in close-up. The voiceover or commentary focuses on details: texture, weight, packaging. This process is often ritualistic. The hands become stage and spotlight. Sometimes, the sounds of the product — tapping, crinkling, unsealing — are given equal importance.

### Workout Videos

Workout videos tend to be structured, the frame rarely moves. A single figure — often the instructor — demonstrates a sequence of exercises against a mostly clean background, punctuated by timers. What comes next is always known: a countdown, a title, a transition. The titles of these videos are unusually long and descriptive: “"20 MIN FULL BODY WORKOUT - Small Space Friendly (No Equipment, No Jumping)” 

---

### ASMR

ASMR videos operate in a completely different sensory register. Rather than sight or movement, they engage hearing, often in exaggerated or unusual ways. Whispering becomes the dominant mode of speech. Everyday sounds — brushing hair, cutting soap, chewing food — are recorded with heightened sensitivity. These videos typically have little or no narrative. Their appeal lies in rhythm, repetition, and texture. Though often dismissed as niche or strange, ASMR represents a significant aesthetic development in online video: one that favors intimacy, slowness, and the microscopic over plot or spectacle.

### Vlogs and GRWM Videos

Vlogs (video blogs) are among the most flexible formats. They range from travel diaries to mundane daily routines. Recently, GRWM (“Get Ready With Me”) has emerged as a distinct subform, usually centered around preparing for a day or an event. These videos often begin with the camera placed in a bedroom or bathroom, facing the creator as they narrate personal thoughts, apply makeup, or choose clothing. There is a casual, almost diary-like quality to these videos. Music fades in and out. Edits are minimal. What matters is the act of sharing — not just the finished look, but the process of getting there.

### Gaming Videos

Gaming content forms an entire ecosystem within YouTube. At first glance, it seems to be about gameplay — a record of what’s happening on-screen. But these videos are just as much about the person behind the voice: their reactions, commentary, humor, and persona. Some gamers appear on screen via webcam, others remain unseen. The gameplay becomes a backdrop for conversation, self-expression, and community engagement. These videos often feature high-energy editing, inside jokes, and references to other creators or fan cultures.

---

### Extreme Challenges and Spectacle

Another popular genre revolves around extremes — both physical and conceptual. Whether it’s a challenge to stay awake for 72 hours, a large-scale social experiment, or a stunt involving absurd amounts of money, these videos are crafted to go viral. They rely on tension, escalation, and resolution. Platforms reward spectacle. One of the most well-known creators in this genre, MrBeast, constructs videos with massive budgets and artificial constraints. The drama is real in structure, even if staged in content. The viewing experience is immersive because it constantly promises “what happens next.”

---

### Q&A and Talking Head Videos

At the opposite end of the spectrum is the simple talking head video — a person facing the camera, answering questions from their audience. There are no stunts or surprises. The structure is conversational and slow. The intimacy of these videos relies not on production, but on the perceived connection between creator and viewer. They are about trust, transparency, and relatability.
